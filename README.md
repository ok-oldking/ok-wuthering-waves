Automation for Wuthering waves

* Farm Boss Echo (Dreamless, Jue)
* Auto Combat (Beats 90% players for [fully supported characters](src/chars))
* Auto Skip Dialogs in Quests

### How to Run

* Download the 7z from [release](releases), extract and run the exe
* May need to add the app folder to Windows Defender white list.
* Run the exe as Admin, because we need permission to send key and mouse event
* Game must be a 16:9 ratio like 1920x1080, 3840x2160, lowest supported resolution is 1280*720
* Can run while game is in background, but not minimized

### Development

use Python 3.11, other versions might work but not tested

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_debug.py
```
