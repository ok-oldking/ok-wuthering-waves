### FAQ

1. Do not extract in a directory with non-English characters.
2. Add the download and extraction directories to the antivirus software or Windows Defender whitelist, then extract the
   files again.
3. If you encounter an error when running the program, try extracting the files again.
4. You may need to turn off Windows HDR, eye protection low blue light mode, and automatic application color management
   in advanced display settings. Use default brightness for games, disable all features that change game colors, like
   Nvidia/AMD game filters/sharpening, and close any overlays displaying FPS, GPU information, etc.
5. If you are not using the default QER keys, change the keys in the ok-ww settings. Mouse side buttons are not
   supported as shortcuts; otherwise, they will only perform basic attacks.
6. If ok-ww is not updated to the latest version, update to the latest version.
7. If you have manually changed the DPI settings of Wuthering Waves or the Wuthering Waves launcher, reset them.
8. If the update does not open, manually copy the files from the update folder to overwrite the installation, or
    download the latest version from the group files and overwrite.
9. The automatic battle and automatic pickup features are not enabled by default. You need to click "Trigger" to enable
    them.
10. The minimum resolution is 1280x720, and it is best to choose a resolution that is 16:9. Wider resolutions (like 21:
    9) might work for some features.
11. Ensure the game can run stably at 60fps; otherwise, the battle may end prematurely, and you may not be able to pick
    up the sound skeleton. If this is not possible, try lowering the graphics resolution.
12. If you still have issues, submit a BUG report.
